 # Toontown: The Grindworks - Controller Support

## A note from the fork owner:

This fork of Toontown: The Grindworks aims to add native controller support for the game. If you are playing on a Steam Deck or ROG Ally, the game should work natively without needing to map buttons in the Steam interface.

Please see the Issues tab of this repository to view any bugs or issues with controller support. The game otherwise should work without any issue - you can switch back and forth between controller/mouse and keyboard seamlessly.

Feel free to open a new issue if any further bugs are spotted or if you have any feedback.

## Original details of Toontown: The Grindworks

This is a single-player game based on Disney's Toontown Online developed with the Godot Engine.

## Requirements

- Godot v4.4
